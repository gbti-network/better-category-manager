A WordPress plugin for advanced category management.

== Description ==

Better Category Manager provides an enhanced interface for managing WordPress categories. It offers an intuitive way to organize your post categories with features that go beyond the standard WordPress category management.

= Key Features =

* **Advanced Category Management** - Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for organizing categories hierarchically
* **Bulk Editing** - Edit multiple categories at once to save time
* **Import/Export** - Easily transfer your category structures between sites

= Taxonomy Support =

This free version of Better Category Manager works **only with WordPress post categories**. It does not support custom taxonomies, tags, or other term types.

For full taxonomy management across all WordPress taxonomies, please check out our premium [Better Taxonomy Manager](https://gbti.network/products/better-taxonomy-manager/) plugin, available exclusively to GBTI Network members.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `better-category-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Yes, the plugin provides a link to the legacy category manager in the top-right corner of the interface.

= Can I import categories from another site? =

Yes, the plugin includes an import/export feature that allows you to transfer category structures between WordPress sites.

= Will this plugin affect my existing categories? =

== External services ==

This plugin offers an optional integration with the OpenAI API for generating category descriptions:
* **What it does**: When enabled and configured with an API key, the plugin can generate descriptive text for your categories using OpenAI's language models.
* **When data is sent**: Data is only sent to OpenAI when you explicitly click the "Generate Description" button in the category editor.
* **What data is sent**: The plugin sends the category name and a customizable prompt to OpenAI's servers.
* **Terms of Service**: [OpenAI Terms of Service](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use)
* **Privacy Policy**: [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)

This feature is completely optional and requires you to provide your own OpenAI API key in the plugin settings. No data is sent to OpenAI unless you explicitly initiate the description generation.
